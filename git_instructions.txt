Create the remote repository, and get the URL such as git@github.com:/youruser/somename.git or https://github.com/youruser/somename.git

    If your local GIT repo is already set up, skips steps 2 and 3

    Locally, at the root directory of your source, git init

    2a. If you initialize the repo with a .gitignore and a README.md you should do a git pull {url from step 1} to ensure you don't commit files to source that you want to ignore ;)

    Locally, add and commit what you want in your initial repo (for everything, git add . then git commit -m 'initial commit comment')

    to attach your remote repo with the name 'origin' (like cloning would do)
    git remote add origin [URL From Step 1]
    Execute git pull origin master to pull the remote branch so that they are in sync.
    to push up your master branch (change master to something else for a different branch):
    git push origin master
	
	List branches
	$ git branch
	
	Create branch
	$ git branch "name"
	
	Push new branch to repository
	$ git push -u origin refactoring
	
	Switch to branch to work on it
	$git checkout refactoring
	
To push to remote repository
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "refactored code to be object oriented"
$ git push
